Version 3.2.0.1 (v3.2 Release)

- Added application auto update support. By installing this version of the app, auto update 
  functionality will be available for all future versions of the application.

- Disabled panel adjustments when Hide Title Bar is checked for a panel. This is to fix an 
  issue where panel adjustments (X-Pos, Y-Pos, Width, and Height) will behave erratically when 
  Hide Title Bar is checked.

- Increased default delay for auto-clicking "Ready to Fly" button from 2 seconds to 4 seconds 
  in regard to Auto Pop Out Panels feature.
