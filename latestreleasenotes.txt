Version 3.4.2.0 

This release is optional and please feel to skip this update.

Change Log:

* Major change in how profile is bound to an aircraft. Previously, a profile is bound to an
aircraft livery which requires you to activate binding when switching livery for the same 
aircraft. With this update, a profile is now bound to an aircraft so you no longer need to 
perform the binding step when switching livery. As you change active aircraft to fly, all 
existing livery binding will be automatically converted to aircraft binding if one exists. 
Also, a profile can still be bound to multiple aircrafts if you so choose such as when 
flying multiple variations of Cessna 172. This change has been a long awaited request to 
simplify your profile bindings. 

* Added auto assignment of aircraft binding for a newly created profile if the active 
aircraft has no previous profile binding specified.

* Added new keyboard shortcuts to move and resize pop outs. Please click on a new 
information icon in the upper right corner of panel configuration screen for instruction in 
how to use these new keyboard shortcuts.

* Added new setting to minimize pop out manager after panels have been popped out.

* Added work around for SU10 Beta issue when after panel separations, panels' size become 
so big and they block most of the game window for lower resolution screen and prevented Pop 
Out Panel Manager from popping out the next panel. 

* Made improvements to how panels are separated during pop out process.

* Fixed an issue when adjusting position and size of a pop out, it may not work correctly 
on some PC configuration.

Known issue:

* When changing the width or height of a pop up that has Hide Title Bar enable, it will 
sometime break the Hide Title Bar setting and the only way to fix this is to re-pop out the
panel. Currently, this is a bug in MSFS in how it handles the sizing and rendering of pop 
outs window.
