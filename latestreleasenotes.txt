Version 3.3.4.0

- Fixed issue when using Auto Pop Out Panel feature in conjunction with Auto Disable 
  Track IR setting. When performing cold start on G1000 / G1000 NXi equipped plane with
  Power on required checked, PFD and MFD fail to turn on or they will turn off by themselves.
  This resulted in pop out process to fail.

- Fixed issue when using Auto Pop Out Panel and the game is in Windows mode, Pop Out Manager
  fails to automatically click the "Ready to Fly" button.

- Made improvements to the detection of flight starts and flight ends. This help to resolve an
  issue when exiting a flight, Pop Out Manager tries to pop out panels again.

- Added touch enabled panel experimental feature. Please see github repo README.md on
  how to use this feature. This feature tries to workaround an outstanding issue regarding lack 
  of support by MSFS with pop out that has touch component (GTN750, King Air 350, Built-in panels
  such as Check List, ATC, etc).

- Updated documentation and how to videos.
