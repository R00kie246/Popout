Version 3.4.1.0 

This release is optional and changes in this release is solely focus on addressing issues
regarding touch panel capabilities as well as making improvements to touch feature. Panels
I used for testing are PMT GTN750, WT G3X mod, PMS GTN530, FBW A32NX EFB, King Air 350 
PFD/MFD touch screen.

When using SpaceDesk, if touch is not registering consistently, please increase touch down 
touch up delay to 25ms or higher in preferences touch settings to improve sensitivity in 
registering touch input.

Change Log:

* Implemented new algorithm to improve general performance for touch panel.

* Button touches are now more responsive. On touch monitor, lag after touch had been 
minimized and is now performing much closer to a mouse click. On SpaceDesk, the lag is more 
in line with latency of remote display technology. When using SpaceDesk, you can increase 
touch delay to 25ms in preference settings to account for the latency if your touch is not 
register consistently.

* You can now slide your finger to pan the map in panel. There is still a slight delay but 
touch response is much improved.

* Full screen mode for touch panel can now be turned on.

* Improved scroll bars touch response. They can be dragged and moved much more easily.

* Added adjustable flight control refocus (0.5 sec to 2 sec). The lowest setting makes flight
control input refocus seems instantaneous after touch inactivity.

* Added ability to disable flight control refocus for a panel. Set panel to "Disable Game 
Refocus" will be useful in panel such as Flybywire A32NX EFB since textbox entries in this 
panel will lose focus if mouse cursor moves away from EFB.
