Version 3.4.3

This release is optional and please feel to skip this update.

Change Log:

* Added ability to remember MSFS game window size and location for aircraft profile when 
running the game in windows display mode. This new preference setting is used to resize 
game window to match original size and location of MSFS game window when panel profile was
defined initially. For existing aircraft profile, when running the game in windows display
mode, the profile will automatically save MSFS game window position after the first 
successful pop out.

* Added ability to include in-game menu bar panels such as VFR Map, ATC, Checklist, etc to 
aircraft profile. During the pop out process, if any in-game menu bar panels are in popped 
out state, they will be included in panel configurations. This feature will only work if 
in-game menu bar panels are popped out and if using in conjunction with auto pop out, it 
relies on MSFS re-opens these panels when flight starts (SU 10+). This also allows in-game
menu bar panels to be touch enabled. Toggling the include in-game menu bar panels checkbox
for a profile will reset these panels' inclusion and configurations. When using this 
feature with Auto Pop Out, there will be a delay in the pop out process to allow in-game 
menu bar panels to appear on screen before they're being configured to previously defined 
settings.

* Added UI cue to show number circles momentarily when popping out panel.

* Fixed an issue where touch does not work for panel when using full screen mode.
