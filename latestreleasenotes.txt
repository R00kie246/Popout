Version 3.3.7

- Fixed an issue where panel number circles are displayed at incorrect location instead of at 
  the location where you clicked your mouse. This issue will most likely occur if your monitor 
  display scale is set to greater than 100% in Windows display setting.

- Fixed an issue where panel number circles cannot be move immediately after the completion of
  panel selection.

- Added support for multi window (new in SU10 beta) so the app does not close the add-on window 
  when pop out starts.

Known Issue:

* Currently, the time it takes for Auto Pop Out Panel to execute for G1000 based planes which 
  require power on for cold start is much longer (can be up to 20 seconds) than previous 
  version of the app. The reason is the time it takes to search and click the "Ready to Fly" 
  button is much longer than before to account for various users' screen resolutions. A solution
  has already been created by me to totally skip the "Ready to Fly" button check and I'll 
  incorporate this change into next major release of the application.
