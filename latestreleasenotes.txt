Version 3.3.7

- Fixed an issue where panel number circles are displayed at the incorrect location instead of 
  at the location where you clicked your mouse. This issue will most likely occur if your monitor 
  display scale is greater than 100% in Windows display setting.

- Fixed an issue where panel number circles cannot be move immediately after the completion of
  panel selection.

- Added support for multi window (new in SU10 beta) so the app does not close the add-on window 
  when pop out starts.
