Version 3.4.6.0

** IMPORTANT ** 
This release should only be used with MSFS SU12 (1.31.18.0 or higher). Since SU12
has breaking changes that affect how pop out works, this release is not compatible 
with earlier version of MSFS.

Change Log:

* Added SU12 compatibility. (Not compatible with current AAU1 MSFS release)
