Version 3.3.6.0 (HOT FIX)

- Resolved an issue where panel separation fails if your MSFS game window is not on the same 
  monitor as where the panels are initially popped out (upper left corner).

Version 3.3.5.0 

This update is optional. You can safely skip this version if you do not require the following
application fixes.

- Fixed an issue when using auto pop out panel in combination with power on during cold start for 
  the following two G1000 planes (Cessna 172 and Cessna 208B Grand Caravan), instrumentations are 
  not powering on to allow pop out to occur.

- Fixed an issue when panels are designated as full screen mode, they're not resizing to full 
  screen after they're popped out.

- Fixed an issue when using auto pop out panel, "Ready to Fly" button may not get click when 
  interface scale is set to higher than 70. Unfortunately, because of how MSFS coded this 
  particular button, this fix may add few extra seconds to the duration of auto pop out process 
  since the application needs to search for the button to click. To speed up the pop out process, 
  you can try to set auto pop out panel wait delays to minimum of 1 second in preferences menu and
  increase one second at a time until pop out works flawlessly for your system.

- Updated verbiage for "Save Auto Panning Camera" button to "Override Auto Panning Camera". This 
  is to clear the confusion when initially selecting panels for a profile, clicking this button 
  eems to be required. "Override Auto Panning Camera" is only needed when your camera viewport has 
  changed for an existing profile and you do not want to recreate a new  profile to set new panel 
  locations.

- Made improvement to the behavior of Track IR (enable/disable) when using the application.
