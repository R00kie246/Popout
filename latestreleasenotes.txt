Version 3.4.3.0 

This release is optional and please feel to skip this update.

Change Log:

* Added ability to remember MSFS game window size and location for aircraft profile when 
running the game in windows display mode. This new setting is used to resize game window to
match original size and location of MSFS game window when panel profile was defined 
initially. For existing aircraft profile, when running the game in windows display mode, 
the profile will automatically save MSFS game window position after the first successful 
pop out.

* Added ability to include in-game menu bar panels such as VFR Map, ATC, Checklist, etc to 
aircraft profile. During the pop out process, if any in-game menu bar panels are in popped 
out state, they will be included in panel configurations. This feature will only work if 
in-game menu bar panels are popped out initially and it also rely on MSFS re-opens these 
panels when flight starts (SU 10+).

* Added UI cue to show number circles momentarily when popping out panel to facilitate 
troubleshooting.
