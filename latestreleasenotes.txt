Version 3.4.5.0

This release is optional and please feel to skip this update.

Change Log:

* Added new preference option by default to auto close MSFS Pop Out Manager when MSFS
exits.

* Fixed an issue when using "Power on required to pop out panels for cold start" for G1000 
and G3000 equipped aircraft, the pop out process gets stuck during the final step after 
panels have been popped out but before battery and avionics are to be turned off.
