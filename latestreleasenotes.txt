                                   IMPORTANT CHANGES

1. A major change to application architecture resulted in an update download of 60MB. The
   application now includes the updated .NET framework as part of the package and you will no 
   longer need to install the framework with a separate download.

2. User data files for the application are being moved to new folder location. You can backup 
   the two user data files "appsettingdata.json" and "userprofiledata.json" in "userdata" 
   folder in your installation directory before performing this update. To do that, you can 
   close this update dialog (do not click update) and exit the application. Backup the two files 
   and relaunch the application. This update dialog will reappear and you can select update a
   gain.

3. New additional community plugin installation is required to to use Auto Pop Out Panel feature.

Change Log:

* Revamped how Auto Pop Out Panel works. The application no longer tries to hunt and click 
  "Ready to Fly" button by using "Ready to Fly Button Skipper" plugin I created. This community
  plugin is included in the installation folder and is required for Auto Pop Out Panel to work. 
  Please copy the folder "zzz-ready-to-fly-button-skipper" in subfolder "community" in your 
  installation location into your MSFS community folder. (Issue #29)
  https://github.com/hawkeye-stan/msfs-popout-panel-manager/issues/29.

* Changed where user data files are stored. Previously, the files are saved in subfolder 
  "userdata" in your installation directory. Now they're moved to your Windows "Documents" 
  folder under "MSFS Pop Out Panel Manager" for easy access. When you first start the 
  application, a data migration step will occur and your user data files will be moved to this 
  new folder location. This change will allow you to install Pop Out Manager to any folder of 
  your choice in your machine since the application no longer requires write access to your 
  installation folder.

* Upgraded the application to use latest .NET 6.0 framework. You'll notice after user data 
  migration, your installation folder will have only one executable file left. Please don't 
  be alarmed when this file is 67MB since all .NET dependencies and application files
  are now packaged into a single file. You no longer need to manually install .NET framework 
  to run this application.

* Updated how the application detects Sim Start and Sim Stop to perform Auto Pop Out. It now 
  uses the much more reliable camera state SimConnect variable for detection.

* Fixed an issue where full screen mode panel does not expand the panel to fill the entire 
  monitor. To use full screen mode correctly, once panel is popped out, move panel to desire 
  monitor and adjust panel window to remove all top/bottom/left/right black bar. Then click 
  on full screen mode checkbox for the panel. Next time when pop out is executed,  panel will 
  be moved to correct monitor and it will expand to fill the entire screen.  [(Issue #27)]

* Added a new feature to enable or disable fall back camera once pop out is completed. You can 
  also define a custom camera view to load if centering cockpit view does not work for you. 
  (Issue #28) https://github.com/hawkeye-stan/msfs-popout-panel-manager/issues/28

* Added feature to change message dialog on screen duration. You can disable on screen message
  by setting the duration value to zero.

* (New for SU10+) Added additional keystroke option to pop out panel Ctrl + Right Ctrl + Left 
  click instead of just Right-Alt Left click. This is designed for users that have a keyboard 
  without the Right-Alt key. To use this feature, please map (CTRL + RIGHT CTRL) in 
  Control Options => Miscellaneous => New UI Window Mode in the game.

* Changed how auto pop out with bound livery works. When you start or restart Pop Out Manager 
  and if you're already in a flight with a bound profile, Pop Out Manager will automatic re-pop
  out all panels for you to sync up all settings based on your cold start or hot start 
  configuration.

* Cleaned up UI and improved UI guidance for user by enable/disabling buttons and actions as 
  needed.

* Lots of the code is rewritten from the ground up for better performance and stability. It 
  also prepares the code architecture for v4.0 new features. Please be patient as I continue
  to implement v4.0. As always, please report issue and comment and I welcome all feedbacks 
  and will do my best to fix or implement requested features.

Known Issues:

* In SU 10 beta (1.27.11.0), when using Touch Enabled and Full Screen Mode simultaneously for 
  a panel, touch event may not register correctly. So if you want to use touch feature, please 
  run the panel in regular pop out window mode instead of full screen.
