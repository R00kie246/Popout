Version 3.3.0

New Features:

- Pop out panel without a title bar can now be moved and resized.

- Added full screen mode capability to panel. This emulates MSFS Alt-Enter keystroke activation. 
To configure, just move the pop out panel to your desire monitor and select "Full Screen Mode" 
in the configuration grid for the panel. [Issue #13](https://github.com/hawkeye-stan/msfs-popout-panel-manager/issues/13)

- Added automatic activation of profile when launching a flight session when a aircraft livery 
is bound to the profile.

- Multiple aircraft liveries can now be bound to a profile. An aircraft livery can only bind to 
a single profile. [Issue #16](https://github.com/hawkeye-stan/msfs-popout-panel-manager/issues/16)

- Removed 'Set Default' profile function.

- Last used profile will be loaded when application starts.

- Added preference configuration to set Auto Panning custom view key binding. It is now possible 
to define key binding from Ctrl-Alt-0 through Ctrl-Alt-9 when saving cockpit custom camera view. 
[Issue #15](https://github.com/hawkeye-stan/msfs-popout-panel-manager/issues/15)

- Added configuration to adjust delay for each of the auto pop out panel steps. 

- Added separate preference settings screen.

- Added auto update feature for future version of the application.



Bug Fixes:

- Application will go back to home screen correctly when a flight session ends.

- Application should reconnect to MSFS correctly when MSFS gracefully quits and restarts.



Known Issues:

- If a panel is in Full Screen Mode, using manual keystroke to return the panel to non-full screen 
mode will make the panel configuration data becomes out of sync. Restart and re-execute the pop out 
profile will solve the problem.

- Activating full screen mode, either through panel configuration grid or using manual Alt-Enter 
keystroke can only be done once per panel. This is a limitation on MSFS side. Subsequent Alt-Enter 
will only maximize the panel to full screen without stretching the content. Restart and re-execute 
the pop out profile will solve the problem.

- Hide Title Bar and Always on Top may not work if Full Screen Mode has been previously activated 
for a panel. This is a limitation on MSFS side on how windows are being handled.
