Version 3.4.0.0 

This release is optional. It added major new features and made performance improvements to the 
core of the application. I encouraged you to update to this latest version. You're still welcome
to skip this update and continue to use older version of the applicaiton but they will no longer 
be supported going forward.

                                         IMPORTANT 

1. In this update, your user data files including your application settings and profiles will 
   be upgraded and moved to new a folder location in user "Documents" foder. You can backup all 
   files within subfolder "userdata" (appsettingdata.json, userprofiledata.json) before this 
   update occurs. To do so, plese close this update dialog using the X button in the upper 
   right corner (do not click update button) and exit the application. Then backup the folder 
   and relaunch the application. This update dialog will reappear and you can perform the update
   at that time. After the data migration, all orphan files in the installation folder will be 
   deleted.

2. A major change to application architecture resulted in an update download size of 60MB. The 
   update now includes .NET framework 6.0 as part of the package and you will no longer need 
   to install .NET framework with a separate download.

3. New additional community plugin installation is required to use Auto Pop Out Panel feature.
   Please see information below regarding Auto Pop Out Panel improvement for installation 
   instruciton.

Change Log:

* Changed where user data files are stored. Previously, the files are saved in subfolder 
  "userdata" in your installation folder. Now they're moved to your Windows "Documents" 
  folder under "MSFS Pop Out Panel Manager" for easy access. When you first start the 
  application, a data migration step will occur and your user data files will be upgraded and 
  moved to this new folder location. This change will allow you to install Pop Out Manager to 
  folder of your choice on your machine since the application no longer requires write access
  to your installation folder.

* Upgraded the application to use latest .NET 6.0 framework. You'll notice after user data 
  migration, your installation folder will have only one executable file left. Please don't 
  be alarmed when this file is 60MB since all .NET dependencies and application files
  are now packaged into a single file. You no longer need to manually install .NET framework 
  to run this application.

* Major improvement in how Auto Pop Out Panel works. The application no longer tries to hunt 
  and click "Ready to Fly" button to continue pop out process by using "Ready to Fly Button 
  Skipper" plugin I created. This plugin is included in the installation folder and is 
  required for Auto Pop Out Panel to work. Please copy the folder 
  "zzz-ready-to-fly-button-skipper" into your MSFS community folder.

* Major improvement in support for touch enabled panel. Using SU10 Beta v1.27.11, touch panel
  capabilities has greatly improved including new support for touch down and touch up events. 
  This update enables smooth touch operations (click and drag) for panel running on connected
  touch monitor or on tablet using software tool such as SpaceDesk. There is a new preference
  settings section for touch operation adjustments. Please see README.md for current known 
  issue and workaround for touch operations.

* Updated how the application detects Sim Start and Sim Stop to perform Auto Pop Out. It now 
  uses the much more reliable camera state SimConnect variable for detection.

* Fixed an issue where full screen mode panel does not expand the panel to fill the entire 
  monitor. To use full screen mode correctly, once panel is popped out, move panel to desire 
  monitor and adjust panel window to remove all top/bottom/left/right black bar. Then click 
  on full screen mode checkbox for the panel. Next time when pop out is executed,  panel will 
  be moved to correct monitor and it will expand to fill the entire screen.  [(Issue #27)]

* Added a new feature to enable or disable fall back camera once pop out is completed. You can 
  also define a custom camera view to load if centering cockpit view does not work for you. 
  (Issue #28) https://github.com/hawkeye-stan/msfs-popout-panel-manager/issues/28

* Added feature to change message dialog on screen duration. You can disable on screen message
  by setting the duration value to zero.

* (New for SU10) Added additional keystroke option to pop out panel Ctrl + Right Ctrl + Left 
  click instead of just Right-Alt + Left click. This is designed for users that have a keyboard 
  without the Right-Alt key. To use this feature, please map (CTRL + RIGHT CTRL) in 
  Control Options => Miscellaneous => New UI Window Mode in the game.

* Cleaned up UI and improved UI guidance for user by enabling/disabling buttons and actions 
  throughout the pop out process.

* Lots of the code is rewritten from the ground up for better performance and stability. It 
  also prepares the code architecture for v4.0 new features. Please be patient as I continue
  to implement v4.0. As always, please report issue and comment and I welcome all feedbacks 
  and will do my best to fix or implement requested features.

Known Issues:

* In SU 10 beta (1.27.11.0), when using Touch Enabled and Full Screen Mode simultaneously for 
  a panel, touch event may not register correctly. Please run the panel in regular pop out 
  window with "Hide toolbar" option instead of full screen mode.
